# OVERVIEW

When you enter a place in the input field, the search for the typical fast food restaurant in that place is automatically performed by chrome. Also, the next line of code will automatically find the fast food store at your current location. It uses [GeoJS API](https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/) to get the current location.
